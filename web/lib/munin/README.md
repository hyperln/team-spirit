# Munin lib

Munin was one of Odin's ravens. The name means ["memory" or "mind"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huginn_and_Muninn) and seems like a fitting name for a database and authentication wrapper lib.

This is a [Supabase](https://supabase.io) wrapper. See the [docs](https://supabase.io/docs/reference/javascript/supabase-client) for further information.
